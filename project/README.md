# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

Have you ever asked yourself if a truly reliable review existed? The internet is full of both hypercritic and uncritical users, which makes it hard to get an idea on a product from its reviews. Is there a way to define clear metrics based on such unreliable material? This project's goal is to determine the magnitude of the correlation between review and sales, as well as exploring the role that Amazon various features - like the suggestion system and the product categorization - play in this picture.
We believe trying to get some insight out of this confused system could help the whole community of Amazon buyers.
We verified that the Amazon reviews dataset contains all the necessary information necessary to answer these questions.

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

Review quality vs. Review quantity. Which of the two metrics is more representative of the product quality and popolarity?

Influence of reviewer personality. Is there a trend in a user's review history that allows to consider him to be biased or unbiased?

Influence of "also bought..." feature. What's the effect of this feature? Does it rise sales of potentially "bad" product which happen to be associated with "good" product (where "bad" and "good have to be formally defined).

#review / #sales ratio. Does a commercially successful product implies many reviews? What about the inverse relationship?

Product Categorization. Is there a correlation between the product categorization and the reviews quantity/quality? Do generic categories have more reviews than niche categories?
